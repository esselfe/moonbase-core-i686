The S-Nail (formerly known as heirloom-mailx) package contains mailx, a
command-line Mail User Agent derived from Berkeley Mail which is
intended to provide the functionality of the POSIX mailx command with
additional support for MIME messages, IMAP (including caching), POP3,
SMTP, S/MIME, message threading/sorting, scoring, and filtering.  S-Nail
is especially useful for writing scripts and batch processing.
