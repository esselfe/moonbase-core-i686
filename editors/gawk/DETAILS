gawk - Free version of awk
gawk performs simple data reformatting tasks, such as making changes in various
text files whenever certain patterns appear or extracting data from parts of
certain lines while discarding the rest, with just a few lines of code.
It provides several useful extensions not found in other implementations.
It is upwardly compatible with the latest POSIX specification of awk.
