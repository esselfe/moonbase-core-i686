pkgconf is a program which helps to configure compiler and linker flags for
development libraries. It is similar to pkg-config from freedesktop.org.
libpkgconf is a library which provides access to most of pkgconf's functionality
to allow other tooling such as compilers and IDEs to discover and use libraries
configured by pkgconf.
