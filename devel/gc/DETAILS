cat << EOF
The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as a garbage
collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It is also used by a number of
programming language implementations that use C as intermediate code.
Alternatively, it may be used as a leak detector for C or C++ programs
A slightly older version of the garbage collector is also included as part of
the GNU compiler (gcc) distribution.
