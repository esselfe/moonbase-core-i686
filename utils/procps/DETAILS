procps-ng is a fork of the procps project. This project provides command line and full 
screen utilities for browsing procfs, a "pseudo" file system dynamically generated by 
the kernel to provide information about the status of entries in its process table (such 
as whether the process is running, stopped, or a "zombie").

It contains free, kill, pkill, pgrep, pmap, ps, pwdx, skill, slabtop, snice, sysctl, tload,
top, uptime, vmstat, w, and watch.
