'Less' is a paginator file similar to 'more, but that allows backward as well
as forward movement through the file. In addition, it doesn't have to read the
entire input file before starting, so it starts large files faster than text
editors like vi. Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some terminals) so it can
run on a variety of terminals; there is even limited support for hard copy
terminals.
