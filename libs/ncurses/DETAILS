ncurses - Displays and updates text on text-only terminals.
The ncurses (new curses) library is a free software emulation of curses
in System V Release 4.0 and more. It uses terminfo format, supports pads
and color and multiple highlights and forms chracters and function-key
mapping, and has all the other SYSV-curses enhancements over BSD curses.
It should port easily to any ANSI/POSIX-conforming UNIX-like system.
The distribution includes the library and support utilities, including a
terminfo compiler tic, a decompiler infocmp, clear, tput, tset, and a
termcap conversion tool captoinfo.
