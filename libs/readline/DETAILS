readline - Lets users edit command lines as they are typed in
The Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications that
allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs and vi
editing modes are available. The Readline library includes additional functions
to maintain a list of previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps
reedit those lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.
