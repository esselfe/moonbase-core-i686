cat << EOF
The popt library exists essentially for parsing command line options.
Some specific advantages of popt are no global variables (allowing
multiple passes in parsing argv), parsing an arbitrary array of
argv-style elements (allowing parsing of command-line-strings from any
source), a standard method of option aliasing, ability to exec external
option filters, and automatica generation of help and usage messages.
