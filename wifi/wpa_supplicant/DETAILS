wpa_supplicant is a WPA Supplicant for Linux with support for
WPA and WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN). Supplicant is the IEEE 802.1X/WPA
component that is used in the client stations. It implements
key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator and it controls the
roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication/association of the wlan driver.
wpa_supplicant is designed to be a "daemon" program that runs in the
background and acts as the backend component controlling the wireless
connection. wpa_supplicant supports separate frontend programs and an
example text-based frontend, wpa_cli, is included with wpa_supplicant.
