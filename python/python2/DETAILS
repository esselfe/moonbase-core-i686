Python 2 is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language.  It combines remarkable power with very clear syntax, and
isn't difficult to learn. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high
level data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many
system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (Tk,
Mac, MFC, GTK+, Qt, wxWindows).  Newbuilt-in modules are easily written
in C or C++. Python is also usable as an extension language for
applications that need a programmable interface.
