cat <<EOF
libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink
developers. There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating,
constructing of both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive
and easy to get wrong. This library aims to provide simple helpers
that allows you to re-use code and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
