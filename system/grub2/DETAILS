cat << EOF
GNU GRUB is a Multiboot boot loader. It was derived from GRUB, GRand
Unified Bootloader, which was originally designed and implemented by
Erich Stefan Boleyn. Briefly, bootloader is the first software program
that runs when a computer starts. It is responsible for loading and
transferring control to the operating system kernel software (such as
the Hurd or the Linux). The kernel, in turn, initializes the rest of
the operating system (e.g. GNU).  Now with md, LVM and ZFS support!

Sample command to install grub on an ide hard drive with a boot
partition mounted anywhere, and a root partition mounted likewise:

~# grub-install /dev/sda

Sample /boot/grub/grub.cfg file is:

set default=0
set timeout=30

menuentry "Lunar Linux 2.6.31" {
    linux /2.6.31 ramdisk_size=16384 ro
    initrd /initramfs-raid.gz
}

menuentry "Lunar Linux 2.6.31 (emergency initrd boot)" {
    linux /2.6.31 ramdisk_size=16384 ro init=/bin/sh
    initrd /initramfs-raid.gz
}

menuentry "Lunar Linux 2.6.31 (rescue boot)" {
    linux /2.6.31 ramdisk_size=16384 ro init_run=/bin/sh
    initrd /initramfs-raid.gz
}
