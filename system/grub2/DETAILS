cat << EOF
GNU GRUB is a Multiboot boot loader. It was derived from GRUB, GRand Unified
Bootloader, which was originally designed and implemented by Erich Stefan
Boleyn. Briefly, bootloader is the first software program that runs when a
computer starts. It is responsible for loading and transferring control to
the operating system kernel software (such as the Hurd or the Linux).
The kernel, in turn, initializes the rest of the operating system (e.g. GNU).
Now with md, LVM and ZFS support!
