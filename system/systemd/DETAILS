cat << EOF
systemd is a system and session manager for Linux, compatible with SysV
and LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelization
capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services,
offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state,
maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate
transactional dependency-based service control logic.
It can work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
